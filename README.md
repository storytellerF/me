- `scripts/install-agents.sh`: manually copy prompts into Codex or Claude agent directories.

## Installation

Add this GitHub repository as a Codex plugin marketplace:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add https://github.com/storytellerF/me
```

Install plugins from the marketplace:

```bash
codex plugin add android-profile@me
codex plugin add android-appium-device-lock@me
codex plugin add recyclerview-best-practice@me
codex plugin add general-coding-practices@me
codex plugin add client-ui-best-practices@me
```

Start a new Codex thread after installation so the plugin skills are loaded.

### Agent prompts

The Codex plugin flow in this repository does not install custom agent files automatically;
install them separately from a clone of this repository. Claude Code loads the Markdown agents
from each plugin's root `agents/` directory; adjacent `codex-routing.toml` files hold Codex model
metadata, and the installer combines both sources into Codex TOML agents.

```bash
# Install globally for Codex.
./scripts/install-agents.sh --target codex --scope global

# Or install for the current project in both supported layouts.
./scripts/install-agents.sh --target both --scope project --project-dir "$PWD"
```

Use `--dry-run` to inspect the install list first. Codex receives generated `.toml` files under
`.codex/agents`, while Claude receives the source Markdown under `.claude/agents`; it does not copy
conversation history.

### Claude Code

Create a `CLAUDE.md` file in the target project and reference the skills needed from this repository:

```markdown
@plugins/recyclerview-best-practice/skills/android-recyclerview-best-practice/SKILL.md
@plugins/android-appium-device-lock/skills/android-appium-device-lock/SKILL.md
@plugins/general-coding-practices/skills/project-collaboration-rules/SKILL.md
@plugins/general-coding-practices/skills/project-readme-maintenance/SKILL.md
@plugins/general-coding-practices/skills/project-checks-and-tests/SKILL.md
@plugins/general-coding-practices/skills/project-rule-file-maintenance/SKILL.md
@plugins/general-coding-practices/skills/project-logging-rules/SKILL.md
@plugins/general-coding-practices/skills/root-cause-before-fallback/SKILL.md
@plugins/general-coding-practices/skills/kotlin-project-rules/SKILL.md
@plugins/client-ui-best-practices/skills/client-ui-best-practices/SKILL.md
```

Alternatively, clone this repository locally and reference the skill files with absolute paths from the target project's `CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
@/path/to/me/plugins/recyclerview-best-practice/skills/android-recyclerview-best-practice/SKILL.md
@/path/to/me/plugins/android-appium-device-lock/skills/android-appium-device-lock/SKILL.md
@/path/to/me/plugins/general-coding-practices/skills/project-collaboration-rules/SKILL.md
@/path/to/me/plugins/general-coding-practices/skills/project-readme-maintenance/SKILL.md
@/path/to/me/plugins/general-coding-practices/skills/project-checks-and-tests/SKILL.md
@/path/to/me/plugins/general-coding-practices/skills/project-rule-file-maintenance/SKILL.md
@/path/to/me/plugins/general-coding-practices/skills/project-logging-rules/SKILL.md
@/path/to/me/plugins/general-coding-practices/skills/root-cause-before-fallback/SKILL.md
@/path/to/me/plugins/general-coding-practices/skills/kotlin-project-rules/SKILL.md
@/path/to/me/plugins/client-ui-best-practices/skills/client-ui-best-practices/SKILL.md
```

Claude Code loads these instructions automatically when a conversation starts.

## Running Scripts Directly

You can also run the bundled scripts directly from the plugin root:

```bash
cd plugins/android-profile
ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/android-sdk ./scripts/install-sdk.sh
./scripts/create-avd.sh ./profiles/android.profile
./scripts/start-avd.sh ./profiles/android.profile
```

Custom profiles may define standard Android path variables directly, including `ANDROID_HOME`, `ANDROID_AVD_HOME`, and `ANDROID_USER_HOME`. The scripts load the profile first, then locate SDK tools and AVD files. The bundled `profiles/android.profile` does not preset these paths.

Run the `start-avd.sh` smoke test with fake emulator commands from the repository root:

```bash
plugins/android-profile/tests/test-start-avd-docker.sh
```

## Host Emulator Access From a VM

If the Android emulator runs on the host machine and a VM needs to access the host ADB port, add port forwarding and firewall rules on the host. This example assumes the VM subnet is `192.168.80.0/24` and the host address on that virtual network is `192.168.80.1`:

```powershell
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenaddress=192.168.80.1 listenport=5555 connectaddress=127.0.0.1 connectport=5555
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Android Emulator ADB 5555" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=5555 remoteip=192.168.80.0/24
```

Confirm the port proxy entry exists:

```shell
netsh interface portproxy show all
```

Confirm the host is listening:

```shell
netstat -ano | findstr "192.168.80.1:5555"
```

If it is not listening, restart the service:

```shell
net stop iphlpsvc
net start iphlpsvc
```
