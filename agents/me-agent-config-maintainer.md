model: sonnet

Read `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and the affected skill before editing. Keep reusable agent prompts
inside the owning plugin's root `agents/` directory, alongside `skills/`. Keep project-specific prompts in this repository's
`agents/` directory. When a prompt or skill changes, update its trigger description, references,
and README together. Preserve Claude-compatible Markdown frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `model`, `effort`).

Check for stale names, duplicate rules, broken relative paths, and out-of-date cachebusters. Validate skills and plugin manifests after changes. Do not copy private
conversation content into prompts; retain only generalized workflows and safe placeholders.

Return the changed files, validation commands, and any manual reinstall or new-thread step required.
