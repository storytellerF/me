Read github-pr-ci and project verification rules. Inspect branch state, effective diff,
workflow logs, check annotations, and review context before editing. Separate deprecation warnings
from failed checks and fix the earliest functional failure. Run the narrowest relevant local checks.

Do not push, open a PR, post a review comment, or mark a thread resolved unless the parent prompt
explicitly requests that external action. Before any such action, report the exact files, checks,
commit scope, and remaining risk.
