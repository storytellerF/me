# Project Checks And Tests

For implementation work, keep verification tied to the actual changed surface.

## Rules

- Ensure changed code has appropriate test coverage. Add or update focused tests when behavior changes.
- Run the corresponding tests after code changes, preferring the narrowest meaningful test command first.
- Run the relevant formatter, lint, typecheck, static analysis, or build checks configured by the project.
- If a relevant check or test cannot be run, report what was skipped and why.
- Do not run unrelated expensive suites by default when a narrower project-supported command gives useful coverage.

## Delegated agent

Use `../../agents/test-verification-agent.md` when verification can run independently of implementation.
Give it the changed surface and expected command family; require a concise report of commands run,
failures, skipped checks, and remaining risk. Spawn it with `fork_turns: "none"`; include only the
changed surface, expected behavior, and relevant commands. The parent must wait for the delegated
agent's final report before reporting verification results or returning a final response; do not
treat an active agent as completed.
