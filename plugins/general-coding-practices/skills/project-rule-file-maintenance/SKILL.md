# Project Rule File Maintenance

Keep project guidance files aligned with the conventions future agents and contributors need.

## Rules

- Look for existing rule files before adding new ones, including `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, or local contributor docs.
- Update rule files when a change alters setup commands, test commands, build workflows, architecture conventions, code style expectations, generated files, or agent-specific instructions.
- Keep guidance concise and actionable. Prefer commands, paths, and concrete conventions over broad advice.
- Do not duplicate the same rule across multiple files unless each consumer actually needs it.
- If the project has multiple instruction files, keep their guidance consistent or explain intentional differences.

## Delegated agent

Use `../../agents/documentation-and-rules-maintainer.md` for a focused audit of `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`,
`.cursorrules`, and related guidance after changing workflows or agent prompts. It should report
which file is canonical, what references are stale, and the smallest consistent update. Spawn it with
`fork_turns: "none"` and provide only the changed workflow and relevant guidance paths. The parent
must wait for the delegated agent's final report before editing dependent guidance or returning a
final response; do not treat an active agent as completed.
