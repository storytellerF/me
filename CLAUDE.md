## Agent prompts

Reusable prompts live at plugin root under `plugins/*/agents/`, alongside each plugin's `skills/` directory. The repository
prompt at `agents/me-agent-config-maintainer.md` maintains these files, their triggers, and manual
installation instructions. Claude Code uses the Markdown files directly.
